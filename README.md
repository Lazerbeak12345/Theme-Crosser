# [Theme-Crosser](https://lazerbeak12345.github.io/Theme-Crosser/)

**I've lost interest in maintaining this.** After playing around with other tools that are more lightweight than jquery-ui I've moved on from jquery-ui, and only use jquery itself if I actually have to. As this is under the MIT you may fork this if you have intrest in future development of this project.

Lets you use bootstrap themes with jquery-ui
